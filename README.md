National Institute of Justice's Real-Time Crime Forecasting Challenge
=====================================================================

Simple Ruby scripts to verify the winners; I don't care enough to make sure they work in anybody else's environment, but here they are.  Note that I am not an employee of the Department of Justice, and you should draw your own conclusions.  I'm only providing what my program says.

Dependencies
============
- The directory structure.
- Ruby's shapelib gem.
- The NIJ files.
